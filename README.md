# InternRegistrationForm

This project is projected is waiting for the testing to be completed by the cyber Security department of PGIP before hosting on the Intranet as of 1/10/23

This WebApp is built using ASP.NET MVC. The purpose of this project is to be used in the real world by PGIP to use as their Master Internship Database,
Effectively replacing the current Master Internship list that is stored on an Excel spreadsheet. I am the sole developer for this project. 

As of 12/14/22, I plan on cleaning up the code by refactoring the codes and breaking apart the Home controller into separate controllers for each respective
object / task. I also plan on making the front-end graphically appealing to the user. However, my main priority was to get the WebApp functioning first.
